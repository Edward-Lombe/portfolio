To Ana Belgun

I am writing to express my interest in the position of Early Career Software
Engineer at the CSIRO's Data61 Team (requisition number 59499). Having 8 years
of web development experience, both in front and back end, makes me an ideal
candidate for this position. I love using both TypeScript and JavaScript having
written and deployed numerous production applications using them.

Most of my expertise has been developed through practical experience. The most
significant project that I have designed is a proxy server using Node.js and
written in TypeScript. The purpose of this was to allow us to extend the useful
working life of our main business system by providing JSON interop to an XML
based database. This was achieved by translating the incoming JSON encoded
request into XML, forwarding it to the server and then converting the resulting
XML response back into JSON. This enabled us to rapidly prototype our APIs and
remove the performance overhead of including an XML parser and serializer on
the client.

As I mentioned before, my skills are not only limited to back end applications,
and I know how to make a clean, simple and intuitive front-end facing web
application. This has ranged from designing a metrics and control panel for the
aforementioned proxy server, to a full redesign of our business system to ensure
that we could utilize the latest HTML5 and CSS3 features. It is hard to convey
my visual design skills through a purely textual medium, so I have published a
portfolio containing some of my work, which can be accessed by clicking here.

To finish, I would like to note that I meet all the pre-requisites and
essential criteria listed in the position description. For the desirable
criteria, the only thing I do not have experience in is GIS systems. However my
current role has often required me to take ownership of problems that may not
reside entirely within my realm of expertise. Fortunately I am a fast learner,
and am able to bring myself up to a functional level of competence quickly. I
relish the challenge of learning new systems, and am confident that I could
familiarize myself within a small timeframe.

Whilst there are many more skills and experiences that would be relevant to list
here, for the sake of brevity I will keep this letter short. I would love to be
able to set up a time in which we could talk and discuss the position and my
suitability in more detail. I can be reached by phone at 0474 859 835 or by
email at edward.lombe@icloud.com. The opportunity to work at CSIRO would be an
honor and privilidge, and I thank you for taking the time to consider my
application thus far.
